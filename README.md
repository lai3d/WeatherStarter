Think of all the ways you can now use AFNetworking to communicate with the outside world:
* AFHTTPOperation with AFJSONResponseSerializer, AFPropertyListResponseSerializer, or AFXMLParserResponseSerializer response serializers for parsing structured data  
* UIImageView+AFNetworking for quickly filling in image views  
* Custom AFHTTPSessionManager subclasses to access live web services  
* AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager to keep the user informed  
* AFHTTPOperation with a AFImageResponseSerializer response serializer for loading images  

The power of AFNetworking is yours to deploy!
